# Poche - Read It Later Application

## Project Overview

Poche is a "read it later" application that allows users to save articles from the web and read them later. The project consists of five main components:

1. **Backend** - Self-hosted API server for authentication and article management
2. **Mobile App** - React Native mobile application (iOS/Android) built with Expo
3. **Browser Extension** - Cross-browser extension (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) for saving articles
4. **Web App** - Marketing website with app download links, SEO optimization, and password reset page
5. **Shared** - Shared TypeScript types, utilities, and styling used across all projects

## Architecture

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Hono (Node.js), Better Auth with bearer plugin, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL
- **Mobile App**: React Native with Expo Router, custom markdown renderer
- **Browser Extension**: React with TypeScript, built with Vite
- **Web App**: React with TypeScript, Vite, React Router
- **Shared Package**: TypeScript types, utilities, colors, and markdown parsing (`@poche/shared`)
- **Authentication**: Better Auth (email/password with bearer tokens for API clients)
- **Email**: Resend for transactional emails (password reset)
- **Article Extraction**: Domain-specific configurations (Readability, Defuddle, or raw DOM per domain)
- **Deployment**: Docker & Docker Compose with Nginx reverse proxy
- **SSL/TLS**: Let's Encrypt via Certbot with Cloudflare DNS plugin

### Database Schema

The project uses a PostgreSQL database with the following main tables:

#### `user` table (Better Auth)
- `id` (string, primary key)
- `name` (string) - Display name
- `email` (string, unique)
- `emailVerified` (boolean)
- `image` (string, nullable)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (timestamps)

#### `session` table (Better Auth)
- `id` (string, primary key)
- `token` (string, unique) - Bearer token
- `expiresAt` (timestamp)
- `userId` (string, foreign key)
- `ipAddress`, `userAgent` (metadata)

#### `articles` table
- `id` (integer, auto-generated)
- `userId` (string, foreign key to user)
- `title` (string, nullable) - Article title
- `content` (string, nullable) - Parsed markdown content
- `excerpt` (string, nullable) - Article excerpt
- `url` (string, nullable) - Original article URL
- `siteName` (string, nullable) - Website name
- `author` (string, nullable) - Article author
- `wordCount` (integer, nullable) - Word count for reading time
- `tags` (string, nullable) - Comma-delimited list of tags
- `readingProgress` (integer, default 0) - Reading progress 0-100%
- `isFavorite` (boolean, default false) - Whether article is favorited
- `startedAt` (timestamp, nullable) - When article was first opened
- `finishedAt` (timestamp, nullable) - When article was finished (progress = 100)
- `createdAt`, `updatedAt` (timestamps)

### Authentication

- Email/password authentication via Better Auth
- Bearer token authentication for API clients (browser extensions, mobile apps)
- Better Auth's bearer plugin enables token-based auth alongside cookies
- Session tokens stored in browser extension storage (`chrome.storage.local`) and mobile app AsyncStorage
- Cookie-based auth doesn't work for browser extensions due to cross-origin restrictions
- CSRF protection disabled for mobile app compatibility (mobile apps don't send Origin header)
- Row Level Security equivalent through user-scoped queries

## Workflow

1. **User logs in** to either the mobile app or browser extension

3. **User clicks the browser extension** icon
4. **Extension sends URL** to backend API
5. **Backend extracts article** using domain-specific extraction (Readability, Defuddle, or raw DOM per domain)
6. **Article saved** to PostgreSQL with userId
7. **User views saved articles** in the mobile app (markdown rendered) or extension

## Development

### Backend
- Built with Hono framework
- Uses Better Auth for authentication with bearer plugin
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- **Article extractor**: Domain-specific configurations—each domain can specify a CSS selector to narrow the DOM, elements to remove, and extraction library (Readability, Defuddle, or none/raw DOM); BBC uses raw DOM with targeted element removal for better content preservation
- **Word count**: Improved calculation with proper whitespace splitting
- Docker Compose for development and production
- Hot-reloading in development mode
- Binds to `0.0.0.0` for mobile app access on local network

### Mobile App
- Built with Expo SDK ~54
- Uses Expo Router for file-based routing
- TypeScript for type safety
- **API client**: `lib/api.ts` handles all backend communication
- **AuthContext**: Manages session state and navigation guards
- **Local storage**: Articles stored in AsyncStorage for offline access
- **Image caching**: Uses `expo-file-system/legacy` to download and cache article images locally
- **Background tasks**: Uses `expo-background-task` for periodic article syncing and image caching
- **Animations**: Uses `react-native-reanimated` for smooth article list animations
- **Markdown rendering**: Custom `Markdown` component using shared parsing from `@poche/shared`
- **Custom theme**: Warm color palette with Poche coral accent (#EF4056 light, #F06B7E dark)
- **Environment variables**: API_URL configured via `.env` (local) and `eas.json` (EAS builds)
- **EAS Build**: Configured for iOS and Android production builds with environment secrets

### Browser Extension
- Built with Vite (migrated from Webpack)
- React with TypeScript for UI components
- Uses Manifest V3 for Chrome and Firefox
- **Firefox-specific manifest**: Separate `manifest.firefox.json` with `gecko.id` and `data_collection_permissions`
- Token-based authentication (bearer tokens stored in browser storage)
- Cross-browser API compatibility layer
- **Component-based architecture**: Extracted reusable components (Header, StatusMessage, LoginSection, MainSection, etc.)
- **Shared colors**: Uses `@poche/shared` color palette with dynamic CSS variables
- **Light/dark mode**: Automatic switching based on `prefers-color-scheme`

### Web App
- Built with Vite for fast development
- React 18 with TypeScript
- React Router for client-side routing

- `shouldRefreshSession()` - Check if session needs refresh
- `isSessionExpired()` - Check if session has expired
- `calculateSessionExpiry()` - Calculate new session expiry date

### Markdown Parsing (`markdown.ts`)
