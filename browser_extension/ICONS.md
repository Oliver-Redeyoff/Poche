# Extension Icons

The extension requires icon files in the `icons` folder:
- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)  
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons from your main app icon or design new ones. The icons should represent the Poche brand.

### Quick Setup

1. Create an `icons` folder in the `browser_extension` directory
2. Add your icon files with the names above
3. The icons will be copied to the `dist` folder during build

### Using Online Tools

You can use tools like:
- [Favicon Generator](https://favicon.io/)
- [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/)
- [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)

Just upload your source image and download the different sizes.

### Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use simple colored squares or download placeholder icons. The extension will work without icons, but they're recommended for a polished experience.
